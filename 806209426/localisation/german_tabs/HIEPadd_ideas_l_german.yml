 CAM_enemy_partisan:0	"§RIndochina War §!§! "
 CAM_enemy_partisan_desc:0	"Our reoccupation of Indochina has dashed any hopes of the locals for a peaceful transition to indepedence. The Viet Minh, the Issarak and Pathet Lao are amongst the most prominent nationalist groups, often also inspired by communism, which are involved in the insurgencies against our rule. Our hold on Indochina is very tenuous, stability will need to be restored and the Viet Minh in Tonkin defeated if we want to improve the situation.\n§4 This idea will be removed once the Vietn Minh are conquered, then recovery can begin. §!§! "
 CAM_dead_partisan:0	"§OIndochina Pacification §!§! "
 CAM_dead_partisan_desc:0	"With the Viet Minh driven out of the main urban centres and the success of our counterinsurgency campaigns, stability is returning to Indochina. Our hold on the region may yet be maintained!"
 Asia_autonomy:0	"Pushing for Indepedence"
 Asia_autonomy_desc:0	"With the image of European superiority shattered after two World Wars and the Japanese occupation, the drive for independence in Asia grows ever stronger."
 Viet_Minh1:0	"§B§B Indochinese Guerrilla Tradition §!§! "
 Viet_Minh1_desc:0	"Our country is eminently suitable for guerilla warfare and our people have a long tradition of fighting unequal battles. Any foreign invader or occupier will have a hard time subduing us!"
 VIN_isolated_status:0	"§OUnrecognised Independence §!§! "
 VIN_isolated_status_desc:0	"Since the start of the Pacific War we have been trying to establish friendly relations with the great powers, however as of yet they have preferred maintaining good relation with our previous colonial overlords, who don't recognize our independence. Getting any foreign goods into the country is therefore very challenging. If only we had an ideological ally on our borders...\n§G§G  This idea will be removed once we neighbour a communist country. §!§! "
 MAL_occupation_costs:0	"§YReoccupation of Malaysia §!§! "
 MAL_occupation_costs_desc:0	"The reoccupation of our colonies in Malaysia is a costly affair. After we were driven out, other power brokers in the region filled the vacuum. To completely rebuild the economic & political infrastructure we had before will be a long and uncertain process, as we have to thread carefully when handling the locals, especially the communist MNLA. In the meanwhile resource-rich Malaysia can not be relied upon to contribute as much as we'd like to the post-war recovery of Britain itself..."
 MAL_occupation_costs1:0	"§YRe-establishing Our Rule §!§! "
 MAL_occupation_costs1_desc:0	"With the Japanese invasion came economic disruption and profound changes in the political sphere. Mending the economic & political rifts will be a long and uncertain process, as we have to navigate a changed society, with the communist PKM having gained a lot of influence./nAt the same time the metropole requires that we speed up the economic recovery so that the resource-rich colony can contribute maximally to the post-war recovery..."
 Indochina_occupation_costs:0	"§RStruggle in Indochina §!§! "
 Indochina_occupation_costs_desc:0	"Our attempt at restoring of our rule over Indochina has proven... challenging. Communist insurgents such as the Viet Minh prove hard to root out and seem determined to gain indepence, uh, destablize the region. 'La Guerre Sale' is growing more and more unpopular, both home and internationally. We better settle this matter quick...\n§4 This idea will be removed once the Vietn Minh are conquered or if the Viet Minh take control of all their cores. §!§! "
 INS_occupation_costs:0	"§RRevolution in Indonesia §!§! "
 INS_occupation_costs_desc:0	"At the end of the Pacific War some collaborators of the Japanese declared Indonesian Independence and have since been terrorizing the East Indies. While efforts at restoring order and protecting the natives in The Great East & Borneo have been largely successful, revolutionaries control most of Java & Sumatra, where 'Social Revolutions' have uprooted society.\nWe must reassert ourselves upon the entire archipelago with haste, as the international community starts to question the legitimacy our efforts. Much of the financial support & trade we receive from the US is funneled into this campaign, which they deem 'imperialistic' and thus uncceptable. Already threats are made to cut us off from any further aid if we don't come to a negotiated solution...\n§4 This idea will be removed either if we defeat the Indonesian Revolution or when we give up the East Indies entirely. §!§! "
 INS_national_revolution:0	"§RIndonesian National Revolution §!§! "
 INS_national_revolution_desc:0	"The fight for our freedom has finally begun. We will not rest until our guerrilla forces drive the Belanda back into the sea!"
 INS_internal_divides:0	"§ODivides within the Revolution §!§! "
 INS_internal_divides_desc:0	"While they are united in the fight for independence, the groups backing the revolution are as varied as the many islands of our country. Radicals, communists, islamists and regionalists and many more can be found amongst them. We have to thread carefully to ensure these internal divides aren't exploited by our enemies!"
