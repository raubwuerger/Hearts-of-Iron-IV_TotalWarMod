 japsov.1.t:	"Soviet Invasion of Manchuria and Korea"
 japsov.1.d:	"With the end of the fascist threat to the west it's now time to end the imperialistic ambitions of Japan once and for all. Japan is already at war and left their border with the Soviet Union completely empty which is an excellent chance for us to break the non-aggression pact and invade Manchuria and Korea to claim them as a part of our sphere of influence."
 japsov.1.a:	"Invade Manchuria at once and destroy Japan."
 japsov.1.b:	"Don't intervene - China was never important to us anyway."
 japsov.2.t:	"The End of the Soviet Union"
 japsov.2.d:	"German Reich has advanced deep against the Soviet Union. With the loss of three key cities - Moscow, Stalingrad and Leningrad - Stalin has no choice, but to surrender to the Germans. If we don't act now Germany will claim the entire Soviet Union territory as part of their new Reichkomissariats from Siberia to as far as Vladivostok. That cannot happen. We have to break the treaty with the Soviets and invade them unless we want German military bases at our doorstep."
 japsov.2.a:	"Invite the Germans to occupied Vladivostok and partition the Soviet territory with them."
 japsov.2.b:	"Vladivostok is not important. Let the Germans have it."
 japsov.3.t:	"The End of the Soviet Union"
 japsov.3.d:	"Bolshevik Russia since its inception in 1917 has expanded considerably, but eventually fallen into despair with the occurring invasion of the Axis powers led by the Nazi Germany. German forces were competent enough to capture Moscow, Leningrad and Stalingrad while Vladivostok was claimed by the forces of the Imperial Japan. With the imminent end of the Soviet Union and the following end of the communism in Europe comes the new danger of war between Germany and Japan. The planned peace conference in Vladivostok will show whether Germany and Japan can agree to terms to divide the former Soviet territory. Meanwhile Joseph Stalin had disappeared completely and left Russia possibly through Iran or Afghanistan to seek help elsewhere."
 japsov.3.a:	"What does it mean for us?"
 japsov.3.b:	"The era of the communism is finally over."
 japsov.4.t:	"Peace Treaty of Vladivostok"
 japsov.4.d:	"The future border between Germany and Japan is about to be discussed. What shall we claim during the peace conference?"

 japsov.4.b:	"Let the borders stay as they are now."
 japsov.5.t:	"Peace Treaty of Vladivostok"
 japsov.5.d:	"The future border between Germany and Japan is being discussed in Vladivostok. Japanese delegation proposed the border between our empires set on the Lake Baikal. How do we respond?"
 japsov.5.a:	"Let the era of peace and prosperity between Germany and Japan begin."
 japsov.5.b:	"Treaty with Japan? They are next to be conquered by our armies."
 japsov.6.t:	"New Mongol Empire?"
 japsov.6.d:	"As we control a part of former Mongolian Empire we can return it to our loyal ally."
 japsov.6.a:	"Give Mongolia to Mengjiang."
 japsov.6.b:	"Eat Mengjiang instead."
 japsov.7.t:	"Tuva to Mongolia?"
 japsov.7.d:	"As we control a part of former Mongolian Empire we can return it to our loyal ally."
 japsov.7.a:	"Give Tuva to Mengjiang."
 japsov.7.b:	"They have enough land."
 japsov.8.t:	"The New Era for Mongolia"
 japsov.8.d:	"Our Japanese allies have granted us new territory that we can core. All we have to do is claim that our regime is the true and legal regime of the entire Mongolia."
 japsov.8.a:	"From now on Mengjiang will be Mongolia and Mongolia will be Mengjiang."
 japsov.8.b:	"We didn't ask for any of this."
 japsov.9.t:	"Future of China and Korea"
 japsov.9.d:	"We currently control some of the territory within China and we have a choice of either annexing this land into the Soviet Union or releasing the friendly regime in Korea and returning the rest of the land to our allies from Communist Party of China."
 japsov.9.a:	"Soviet Union, China and Korea will become the three pillars of communism in Asia."
 japsov.9.b:	"One Soviet Union to rule all of Asia."
 japsov.10.t:	"The end of Mengjiang"
 japsov.10.d:	"The idea of Inner Mongolia disappears together with the disappearance of Mengukuo from the map."
 japsov.10.a:	"It was never real anyway."
 chijap.1.t:	"New Masters of China"
 chijap.1.d:	"We've conquered everything that was to conquer in China. Our rule over China is now secured and undisputed. Now we have a choice to make on how to divide the conquered lands between our loyal allies and associates. We've reached an agreement with Wang Jingwei and some of the loyal warlords to give them control over the majority of lands to the North-West, while we are about to retain the direct control over the key coastal ports as well as Cantonese China, Yunnan and the key transport routes into Burma and Indochina. Should we proceed with the planned division of China?"
 chijap.1.a:	"Give Wang Jingwei what was promised. Take the rest."
 chijap.1.b:	"The borders look fine as they are right now..."
 chijap.2.t:	"Tibet in Co-Prosperity Sphere?"
 chijap.2.d:	"As we control the entirety of China we can now propose the formal alliance to Tibet. We could probably persuade them to join our cause by promising the transfer of the Xikang which was a province of the Tibetan Empire long ago."
 chijap.2.a:	"Propose alliance to Tibet. Xikang means nothing."
 chijap.2.b:	"Keep Xikang. Tibet means nothing."
 chijap.3.t:	"Tibet in Co-Prosperity Sphere?"
 chijap.3.d:	"Delegates from Japan want to sell us the province of Xikang and accept our accession into Co-Prosperity Sphere. We would restore the old lands of Tibet, but the price we would have to pay would be a probable war with India and Japanese occupation of our territory."
 chijap.3.a:	"Japanese are going to win the war. Accept Xikang and join them."
 chijap.3.b:	"Japanese are going to lose the war. Don't accept their proposal."
 chijap.4.t:	"Bhutan in Co-Prosperity Sphere?"
 chijap.4.d:	"The next country that can potentially agree to join our faction is the small, mountainous nation of Bhutan. Should we proceed with the negotiations?"
 chijap.4.a:	"Promise to revive the Bhutanese Empire to its former glory"
 chijap.4.b:	"We don't want weaklings in our faction"
 chijap.5.t:	"Bhutan in Co-Prosperity Sphere?"
 chijap.5.d:	"Japanese diplomats visited Thimphu yesterday. They promised us many great things - peace, wealth, security. Should we agree on Japanese proposal to join their faction? What is our response?"
 chijap.5.a:	"Formal alliance with Japan"
 chijap.5.b:	"Neutrality"

 americas.1.d:	"United States of America as a victor of the Great War is an industrial superpower on its own. It's influence reaches far beyond its borders and many minor nations based in the Caribbean, Central and South Americas are ideologically  and economically influenced by the US. Our government may (as long as it stays democratic) influence the nations around us to ensure that no nation on the entire continent joins our enemies when United States eventually join the war on the Allies side.

 americas.18.t:	"Diplomatic Offensive in Argentina"

These troops were then followed by some 200 Ecuadorian armed men, which attacked the Police station at Aguas Verdes, to which the Peruvians reacted by sending an infantry company to Aguas Verdes and repulsing the Ecuadorians back across the Zarumilla.

They covet no gain for themselves and have no thought of territorial expansion. It is their purpose that Japan shall be stripped of all the islands in the Pacific which she has seized or occupied since the beginning of the first World War in 1914, and that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Formosa, and The Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China. Japan will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken by violence and greed. The aforesaid three great powers, mindful of the enslavement of the people of Korea, are determined that in due course Korea shall become free and independent." §!§! \n\nWhether the Allies can make true these ambitions remains to be seen.

If we are victorious, we will get stewardship over the Pacific Islands which Japan gained after World War I as well as temporarily occupy Southern Korea. However most importantly it would be us who will occupy Japan and in the long term should be able to make it a reliable ally./nFurthermore both Japanese conquest and our support for national self-determination could well lead to the opening of many Europnean colonies to our political and economic influence.

Even though we would thereby further strengthen our position in China, victory in the coming struggle against the communists is not a given... Firstly, they will likely also gain more ground; namely in Inner Mongolia and Manchuria. More alarming though is the success of the communists propaganda, which leverages the growing dissatisfaction with our perceived 'passive conduct in the war and corruption', thus bolstering their ranks with defectors from our armies.

 supersiam.11.d:	"Plaek Phibunsongkhram (known simply as as Phibun in the western countries) was one of the leaders of the Royal Siamese Army branch of the Khana Ratsadon (People's Party), a political organization that staged a coup d'état in 1932 which overthrew the absolute monarchy in Siam and replaced it with a constitutional monarchy. Phibun, at the time a lieutenant colonel, quickly rose to prominence in the military as a "man-on-horseback". The 1932 coup was followed by the nationalization of some companies and increasing state control of the economy. The following year, Phibun and allied military officers successfully crushed the Boworadet Rebellion, a royalist revolt led by Prince Boworadet. While King Prajadhipok was not involved in the rebellion, it marked the beginning of a slide which ended in his abdication and replacement by King Ananda Mahidol in 1935."

 hiepset.11.d:	"With the release of La Resistance DLC and patch 1.9 for Hearts of Iron IV the Sino-Japanese War in vanilla was completely broken making the Japanese AI unable to land naval invasions in China and making it extremely incompetent against the Chinese division spam. The ability to land naval invasions was restored in this mod, but without significant buffs Japan controlled by the AI will always lose against China. If you're not using any of the AI mods (like Expert AI) it's highly advisable to slightly boost the strength of the AI controlled Japan through the Custom Game Rules (the mod was tested on v1.10 by boosting Japan twice) to give it a chance against China.
